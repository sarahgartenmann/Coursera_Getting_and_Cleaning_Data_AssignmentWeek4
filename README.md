# Coursera_Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_AssignmentWeek4
This assignment is for the Coursera Course "Getting and Cleaning Data"

The CodeBook.md file contains all of the information describing the data, the variables, and any transformations and work that was performed on the original dataset to generate the final tidy data set found in the tidydata.txt file. 

The run_analysis.R file contains all of the R code written to generate the tidydata.txt file. This process is broken down into the following five steps: 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The tidydata.txt file is the final output.
